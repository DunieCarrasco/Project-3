# How Much of What is Coming from Where?: A Geospatial Analysis of Agricultural Production

In this project we want to analyze the top 16 agricultural-producing states ( SD, ND, NM, OK, CO, WY, MO, AZ, CA, IA, NE, TX, IL, KS, MN, MT), based on the acreage used for crops over the course of years. The data is from the USDA websites https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api/. Using the USDA Api, we gather the acreage used for all crops in these ten states since 1997.


- We have a Grouped Bar Graph through plotly that shows Produce summary of the selected Vegetables and Grains in relation to the Acres Harvested and Acres Planted.
