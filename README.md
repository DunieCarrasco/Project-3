# How Much of What is Coming from Where?: A Geospatial Analysis of Agricultural Production

In this project we want to analyze the top 16 agricultural-producing states ( SD, ND, NM, OK, CO, WY, MO, AZ, CA, IA, NE, TX, IL, KS, MN, MT), based on the acreage used for crops over the course of years. The data is from the USDA websites https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api/. Using the USDA Api, we gather the acreage used for all crops in these ten states since 1997.

# Requirments:

1.) Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2.) Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:

* A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

* A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

* A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

3.) Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4.) Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5.) Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

6.) Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
